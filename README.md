How to make change for x with y

========

1. Open Terminal (command line)

2. cd /dir/of/unzipped/currency/app/

3. bash currency.sh
   
   Note: default output generated from shell script uses:

   "Quarter,25,Dime,10,Nickel,5,Penny,1"

4. To change the argument, open currency.sh and modify the argument string, then re-run step #3.
   Alternatively, you can mimic the shell script right from the command line.
